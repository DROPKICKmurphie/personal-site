    <h2>college daze.</h2>
      <p>
        growing up i wanted to be a writer, i loved writing poems, short stories and even most of my assigned papers in class. i always thought i would studdy writing in college, until i wound up in a graphic communications class in 10th grade and began my discovery of graphic design.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        i swooned over beautiful visiual design and after completing 3 sememsters in high school at my local vocational school decided to pursue it in college.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        i attended columbia college in columbia, sc. a small all-women's liberal arts college. there i studied studio art with an emphasis in graphic design, printmaking, and film photography. i completed a graphic design internship at <a href="http://www.flockandrally.com/" target="_blank">flock & rally</a> a local marketting and events firm and with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goodallgallerycc/" target="_blank">goodall gallery</a> the art gallery on campus at columbia college.

    <h2>post grad.</h2>

      <p>
        i was determined to land a job in my field as sooon as possible. i hit the ground running and landed my first full-time design postion at a local screenprinting shop, <a href="https://www.frenzytees.com/" target="_blank" >frenzy tees</a>. there i helped customers with designs for wearable goods. i also was a customer service representative and bookkeeper there. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
        after a little over a year i began to wonder if i wanted to stick with design throughout my entire career. i loved design but felt like i could expand and do something more. i started looking into frontend development brushing up on my html & css skills through codecademy, free code camp, and skillshare.
      </p>
 
      <p>
        i eventually left frenzy and worked a few customer service based jobs serving in resturants, managing <a href="https://northlightfibers.com/" target="_blank">north light fibers</a> a micro yarn mill, and as a telemarketer at <a href="https://swypefast.com/" target="_blank">swype fast</a>, credit card processing company.

    <h2>currently.</h2>
      <p>
        a recent move to asheville, nc aligned things so that i was able to start <a href="https://www.techtalentsouth.com/" target="_blank">tech talent south's</a> code immersion bootcamp & now that i'm learning the skills to dive into a career in frontend development, i couldn't be more excited.
     </p>
  
       <p>
        when i'm not coding, or designing you can find me knitting hats & socks, reading nonfiction, painting, shooting with my pentax k1000, getting outdoors, traveling, or eating some <i>real</i> good food.
